1 With a dark branch a branch whispers
1 Grass lies underfoot
1 Somewhere an owl is crying
1 Give me your hand, shy baby!
1 Give me your hand, shy BABY!
1 I am with you, your knight and friend
1 You tremble softly for some reason.
1 Do not break your hands
1 And cloak them warmer with a cloak.
1 He saw many wanderings and thickets,
1 In it from bullets of an enemy hole.
1 You wrap yourself in a cloak:
1 Here the mists are creeping cheeses,
1 Here you will burn on swamp fire!
1 Helpless hands breaking
1 You reminded me
2 You reminded ME
1 That princess from distant May
1 The one I love too long
1 Whose mouth burned like rubies ...
2    There is a window before me
1 And the head in captivity of necklaces.
1 I couldnâ€™t keep a tender gaze,
3    I hugged and brutally came off ...
1 How could I, how dare I
2 To destroy this rose of the East!
1 With a dark branch a branch whispers
1 The sky is predawn gray.
1 Give me your hand quick
2 Farewell, shy baby!
1 Give me your hand, shy baby!
