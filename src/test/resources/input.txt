With a dark branch a branch whispers
Grass lies underfoot
Somewhere an owl is crying
Give me your hand, shy baby!
Give me your hand, shy BABY!
I am with you, your knight and friend
You tremble softly for some reason.
Do not break your hands
And cloak them warmer with a cloak.
He saw many wanderings and thickets,
In it from bullets of an enemy hole.
You wrap yourself in a cloak:
Here the mists are creeping cheeses,
Here you will burn on swamp fire!
Helpless hands breaking
You reminded me
You reminded ME
You reminded ME
That princess from distant May
The one I love too long
Whose mouth burned like rubies ...
   There is a window before me
...There is a window before me
And the head in captivity of necklaces.
I couldnâ€™t keep a tender gaze,
   I hugged and brutally came off ...
...I hugged and brutally came off ...
...I hugged and brutally came off ...
How could I, how dare I
To destroy this rose of the East!
To destroy this rose of the East!
With a dark branch a branch whispers
The sky is predawn gray.
Give me your hand quick
Farewell, shy baby!
Farewell, shy baby!
Give me your hand, shy baby!
