Grass lies underfoot
Somewhere an owl is crying
I am with you, your knight and friend
You tremble softly for some reason.
Do not break your hands
And cloak them warmer with a cloak.
He saw many wanderings and thickets,
In it from bullets of an enemy hole.
You wrap yourself in a cloak:
Here the mists are creeping cheeses,
Here you will burn on swamp fire!
Helpless hands breaking
That princess from distant May
The one I love too long
Whose mouth burned like rubies ...
And the head in captivity of necklaces.
I couldnâ€™t keep a tender gaze,
How could I, how dare I
The sky is predawn gray.
Give me your hand quick
